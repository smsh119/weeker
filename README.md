# Weeker - A week planner made with simplicity in mind

## Description

The name Weeker says it all. This web tool allows us to keep track of our weekly activities, which helps us plan our days more effectively and make the most of the time we have available. Indeed, there are a lot of calendar and to-do apps on the market, but they frequently have sophisticated functionality and intricate user interfaces that go above and beyond what we require. This is a really easy substitute for just setting up an hourly system for weekly work. Feel free to use it. Please drop down your review or suggestions for how to make this straightforward software even better. Many thanks!
